# Momentum 2025 Resources for Local First in Expo
Stuff from my local first talk at Momentum Conf 2025

- [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z1wXBFlb3PehYnuh1CBlpZeOvwcARHMmXdWqPFR-yh0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Worst CRDT Ever](https://github.com/keith-kurak/worst-crdt-ever) - my hamfisted attempt to write a CRDT myself in a budgeting app
- [LiveStore example app](https://github.com/betomoedano/livestore-expo-starter/tree/keith/deploy-54-ls3) - quick demonstration of LiveStore with Cloudflare Durable Objects. This was a workshop at Local First Conf 2025, so check out the lessons if you'd like to hack on it yourself.
- [Money Buckets - InstantDB example](https://github.com/keith-kurak/money-buckets-instant) - an app I'm actually building with InstantDB
